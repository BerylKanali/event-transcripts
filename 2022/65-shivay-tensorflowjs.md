## Event Outline
1. Introduction to Tensorflow.JS
2. Benefits of running Tensorflow.js with Nodejs on backend and on Frontend/Client Side
3. Workshop to build a project using TensorFlowjs during live demonstration

## Event

This workshop gives an introduction about Tensorflow.JS which is an open source Javascript Library that allows running machine learning models on the browser itself and helps integrate the models with web applications. Tensorflow.JS gives creators working with Web Development a powerful tool to use with their web apps to create dynamic web apps using machine learning. The developers might require powerful CPUs/GPUs to be used for training of the models. This is where Tensorflow.JS ( TFJS ) comes into the picture. It allows standard machine learning libraries and models to be used directly with Javascript. It runs the models on the Browser ( client side ), or on the backend with Nodejs. And it makes it really easy for the Javascript developers to integrate machine learning models without much knowledge behind how these models work.
