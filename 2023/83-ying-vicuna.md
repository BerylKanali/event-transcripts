## About the Event
We will talk about the training and deployment experiences of Vicuna, which is a high-quality chat assistant. After training the models, we found evaluating them even more difficult, so we launched Chatbot Arena, a crowd-sourced benchmarking platform featuring randomized battles. However, relying on human evaluation is costly and slow, so we study whether we can replace human evaluators with strong LLMs like GPT-4 for evaluating these models. We termed this approach “LLM-as-a-judge”.
