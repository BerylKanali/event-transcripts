## About the Event
This talk will introduce attendees to React, a free and open source JavaScript-based library that encourages declarative component-based development of user interfaces (UI). We will start with covering the basic concepts of front-end web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript before learning how to leverage React to simplify creation of interactive web UIs. This talk will conclude with a recap of what we've learned together and recommendations for continuing to learn about front-end web development and React.
