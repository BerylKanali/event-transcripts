## About the Event
Our talk will delve into the various facets of knowledge graphs, including their traditional uses for data integration, search, and discovery, as well as their modern applications in decision-making, analytics, and predictions. We will explore the sudden surge of interest in knowledge graphs and the interplay with AI trends. Additionally, we'll look beyond LLMs and RAG to gain a broader perspective on the role of knowledge graphs as we go forward in the data landscape. This session promises to provide a comprehensive understanding of why knowledge graphs are currently a hot topic in the tech industry.
This presentation covers:

What commonly defines a knowledge graph (and the surrounding disagreements)
- Traditional uses for data integration, search, and discovery
- Modern uses for decision-making, analytics, and predictions
- The sudden surge of knowledge graphs
- What Knowledge Graphs bring to AI and vice versa - Beyond LLMs and RAG
