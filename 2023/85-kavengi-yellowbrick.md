## About the Event
Yellowbrick is a very convenient Python library for creating visualizers within the machine learning workflow. With just a few lines of code, a wide range of visualizers can be generated for various stages of the ML process; paying homage to the adage “a picture is worth a thousand words”. In this session, we shall briefly introduce the Yellowbrick library and explore the range of visualizers. Then we shall delve into a practical machine learning classification problem and create classification visualizers using the Yellowbrick library. Save the date for this insightful session!
