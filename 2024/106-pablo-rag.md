## About the Event
One of the most popular embodiments of Generative AI are information retrieval (IR) augmented generation (RAG). Such systems use an information retrieval engine (based on semantic embeddings or keyword search) and then use a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract answers to a given query.

These systems require a large amount of computation and are usually implemented in the cloud which presents data privacy issues.

In this talk we will present The RAGged Edge Box project in which basic embedding systems and small local LLMs are packaged inside a multi-platform virtual machine (VirtualBox). The system provides a Web interface that runs locally and allows access to the RAG functionality in a completely private manner. The neural networks run on a ONNX runtime and do not require a GPU. RAG code is implemented in PHP and is easy to modify, requiring a much smaller execution environment than a Python alternative.

## About the Speaker
Dr. Duboue is an independent language technologist. His work focuses on applied language technology and natural language generation. He received a Licenciatura en Computacion degree from Cordoba University (Argentina) in 1998 and M.S., M.Phil and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from Columbia University in the City of New York in 2001, 2003 and 2005. He is passionate about improving society through language technology and splits his time between teaching, doing research and contributing to free software projects. He has taught at Cordoba University, Columbia University, Siglo21 University and has worked for IBM TJ Watson Research as a Research Staff Member.
