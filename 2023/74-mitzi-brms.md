## About the Event
In this webinar Mitzi Morris shows how you can quickly build robust models for data analysis and prediction using BRMS. After a brief overview of the the advantages and limitations of BRMS and a quick review of multi-level regression. We will work through an R-markdown notebook together, to see how to fit, visualize, and test the goodness of the model and resulting estimates.
