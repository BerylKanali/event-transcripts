## About the Event
Julia is a high-level, general-purpose dynamic programming language. Its features are well suited for numerical analysis and computational science. If you have experience programming in another language, you will find that most of your knowledge will be easily transferred to Julia. Refer to the documentation of some [noteworthy differences](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/) from other popular languages: [Matlab](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-MATLAB), [R](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-R), [Python](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-Python-1) and [C/C++](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/noteworthy-differences/#Noteworthy-differences-from-C/C).

This presentation will introduce the basics of machine learning with FluxML in Julia, how it differs from other frameworks, and why it matters.
