## About the Event
Most data projects fail, often without reaching production or delivering business outcomes. Many companies, in their pursuit to be data-driven, adopt an "upside-down approach," leading to wasted resources and no return on investment. Success hinges on four key elements: a strong data culture, the right problem, accurate data, and the right people.

This session will define the "upside-down approach," explore what constitutes a good data culture, and discuss identifying the right business problems. Finally, we'll offer strategies for maintaining a robust data culture to ensure long-term success.

This presentation covers:

- Evidence of an unsuccessful data science team
- A “Data Fable” showing an all-to-real fictional creation of a data team
- The “upside-down” approach to creating a data science team
- Suggestions for how to right the ship if your data science team was formed using the “upside-down” approach
- Cautionary tales for the near future of data science teams and history repeating

**0:56**
**Ugly Truths About Data Science**
* Claire starts by discussing some of the "ugly truths" about data science, including the fact that only 40.5% of companies have a Chief Data Officer, and that less than 25% of companies consider themselves data-driven.
* She cites statistics showing that most employees have access to data they shouldn\'t, and that 80% of analyst time is spent discovering and preparing data.
* She emphasizes that 87% of data science projects never make it to production.

**10:12**
**Data Fable**
* Claire introduces the concept of the "data fable," a fictional story that illustrates the common challenges faced by data science teams.

**14:42**
**Lessons for the Future**
* Claire discusses the lessons that can be learned from the data fable, including the importance of clearly defining the problem to be solved, hiring the right people in the right order, and establishing a data governance framework before hiring data scientists.

**16:11**
**The Upside Down Approach**
* Claire introduces the concept of the "upside down approach" to data science, which involves starting with culture and problem definition before hiring and collecting data.
* She explains that the traditional approach, which involves hiring people first and defining the problem later, is often problematic.

**21:02**
**Culture**
* Claire emphasizes the importance of culture in creating a successful data science team.
* She explains that culture starts at the top and that companies need to understand the value of data and use it to solve business problems.

**22:11**
**The Recommended Approach**
* Claire provides a step-by-step guide to the recommended approach for creating a data science team:
    1. Culture
    2. Problem
    3. Data
    4. People

**25:24**
**Data Culture**

    * Defining the business problem
    * Identifying the right data
    * Measuring ROI
    * Communicating the strategy and its success to stakeholders

**30:54**
**Return On Investment (ROI)**
* Claire emphasizes the importance of quantifying ROI when it comes to data science initiatives.
* She suggests using a variety of metrics to measure success, depending on the specific problem being solved.

**34:04**
**Other Ways Data Can Contribute**
* Claire explains that data can contribute to business value in both direct and indirect ways, such as increasing revenue, decreasing costs, and improving efficiency.

**34:13**
**Communicating Value**
* Claire stresses the importance of clearly communicating the value of data science projects to stakeholders.
* She suggests stating upfront how success will be measured and providing regular updates on progress and outcomes.

**35:04**

0:32
events we are a nonprofit organization this is the team that makes
0:37
it happen my name is RMA barl is out of Nairobi Christina is out of Brooklyn and
0:43
suum is out of India we have a code of conduct and we

2:55
team Dr CLA Sullivan is currently the founder and CEO of CLA Sullivan and Associates a company dedicated to
3:02
providing data science Consulting Services her career spans over 22 years of working with data with interest in
3:08
graphs natural language processing and generative AI she has worked in a variety of settings ranging from
3:15
director level roles to individual contributor at a variety of startups to Academia and the federal government you
3:21
can find Claire on LinkedIn and with that I will be handing over the microphone and screen share to
3:28
Claire excellent thank you rishima it's great to be here uh glad to be invited
3:33
back and um just thanks everybody for tuning in or you know checking the video
3:39
out after the fact I'm going to start by sharing my screen here and I will answer
3:45
the very first question so uh the very first question is always what it is are
3:53
the slides going to be made available and the answer to that question is yes you can go to my GitHub here and you
3:58
will see a link in the in the top under uh talks and presentations um which will take you to a repository with all the
4:04
slides that I'm going to talk about today okay so um let's let's kind of
4:09
dive into it here the title of this talk best practices for creating a data science team um this is just something
4:16
that um I'm kind of passionate about uh which has to do we're going to talk a lot today about data culture and how you
4:23
create data culture and why it's important and so um just these are kind
4:29
of my observations of working with a variety of data science teams over the past 22 years even before it was called
4:35
data science but um let's just let's just kind of dive in and we're we're gonna have some kind of ugly truths here
4:42
um this is this is just you know the obligatory agenda um you know if we're talking about data science teams and how
4:48
to make them successful that implies wait a second are they not successful so we're going to start with some uncomfortable facts about data science
4:56
and data science products um and I'm going to turn this into what call a data Fable here I'll explain what I mean by
5:02
that in a second and then I've got this other thing that I call the upside down approach um and um how it's when you see
5:10
it happening and and when I talk about the data Fable and we get into the upside down approach when I've talked about this before I get a lot of people
5:16
in the room who data scientists who've been working for a few years and they're like oh yeah this is really painful H
5:22
how can we get out of this um this negative side of data science um and and
5:29
fix this thing that I call the upside down approach and then just kind of some lessons for the future of where I see um
5:35
the history is repeating itself here before I get too far in um we've got the chat going and I have the chat window
5:42
open I'm not necessarily going to be looking at it all the time so there will definitely be QA time at the end um if I
5:48
happen to see questions pop up in the chat window great um but probably the
5:53
the the time that you'll have be able to catch my attention most for questions will will be at the end
6:00
okay so let's get into some of these stats all right um so I was um doing
6:06
some looking around various literature here at um what uh what Chief data
6:11
officers are um saying about their companies and the success of their companies and starting off by companies
6:19
who are starting to create these roles of Chief data officer um only 40 this is
6:25
um this is a survey by the way of something um like aund 50 Chief data
6:30
officers from Fortune 1000 companies and of the respondents um
6:37
40.5% said that people even knew what the role of a chief data officer was
6:43
despite the fact that almost 83% of the responding companies had one so they have these people whose job it is to
6:51
kind of Shepherd the whole data process and yet nobody really knows what they should be doing okay well that's not
6:57
great um I will tell you right now that I'm looking at two monitors so if you see me looking over here um that's
7:04
that's what's going on here um it the in 2003 in this data anex sorry data and
7:12
analytics leadership annual executive survey which is the the linked at the
7:17
bottom here um almost 88% of companies said that they were increasing their
7:23
spend and data initiatives especially in data modernization as their highest
7:28
priority um 24% identified their organizations as being data driven okay
7:34
so let's let's stop and think about that one one quarter Le slightly less than
7:40
one quarter of companies in these Fortune 1,000 companies slightly less than one quarter considered themselves
7:45
data driven that's mindboggling to me um 20% 20.6% identified that they have a
7:53
data driven culture or they have a data culture at all so you know we'll talk
7:58
about what we mean by data culture culture here but people people aren't basically saying that they value data is
8:04
what they're saying in that statement um almost 80% cited cultural issues as the
8:10
greatest obstacle for delivering business value from data Investments so you've got you know 20% saying they
8:17
don't have a developed data culture yet almost 80% saying the lack of that culture is what's keeping them from
8:23
getting business value okay so these are some really kind of scary statistics if
8:28
you think about these are big companies these are you know publicly traded companies who are saying yeah we don't
8:34
really know what to do with data okay some more stats um less than half of an
8:41
organization's structured data is being used in making decisions why are you
8:46
collecting data if you're not using it to make decisions that's and then look
8:52
at that subet less than 1% of unstructured data is even analyzed or
8:58
used at all so like 99% of unstructured data is just kind of sitting there doing
9:03
whatever um More than 70% of employees have access to data they shouldn't have
9:09
80% of analyst time is spent just discovering and preparing data and and
9:15
those of you on this call I'm that's probably not a surprise to you I say you know when I give talks I say at least
9:21
80% of my time as a data scientist is actually a data janitor finding the data cleaning the data getting it ready and
9:28
then you know we can have all kinds of discussions about data breaches and data being in silos and um data technology
9:35
that isn't up to the demands the company's placing on it this is not setting up a good scenario here is what
9:41
I'm what I'm hoping you're taking away from this um but here's the one that just kills me
9:48
87% of data science projects never make it to
9:54
production so you have teams of data scientists and data scientists be real
9:59
are not you know the cheapest employees at a company and 87% of their work is
10:05
not making it into use what is up with that okay so this is why I um decided
10:12
that I was going to create this data Fable to try and explain this to people um perhaps some of you on this call have
10:17
read this book the five dysfunctions of a team it's practically mandatory reading if you're going for an MBA um
10:24
which I happen to be doing that and um this this five Len's book here I really
10:30
encourage everyone to read this book especially if you're in management or thinking about going into management um
10:36
really interesting book um and he starts off with what they call lindon's Fable where he creates like this story around
10:44
some fictitious seite um individuals and how it is that they're relating to each
10:50
other how they communicate to each other this is a book all about improving Communications during you know some
10:55
difficult times at a company so I decided to take that same idea and I created a data Fable and I'll tell you
11:02
um I started my my Consulting freelance company here a little less than a year ago and my my marketing department I do
11:09
not fund them very well so you will see that reflected in the quality of my Graphics here so here is the beginning
11:15
of the data Fable we have the CEO and the CEO is is you know thinking here
11:22
that oh boy you know gez all of my competitors they're they're getting data
11:27
scientists and if I'm going to remain competitive I have to do it too so the fomo the fear of missing out is real
11:34
with the CEO the CEO perceives a threat and so when a CEO perceives a threat they're going to act on it so CEO
11:41
contacts HR and says hey hire me some data scientists and HR says yeah let's
11:47
do that but uh we haven't had them before what's a data scientist and they
11:52
sit around and they talk about it and they oh they all have to be phds and experts in natural language processing
11:59
and 10 plus years of experience with pytorch because the CEO heard about pytorch and thought it was great and uh
12:06
yeah if you're doing the math pytorch has not existed for 10 more more years so and actually I have seen that exact
12:12
thing on a job ad before somebody wanted more than 10 you know 10 plus years of experience with pytorch this is you know
12:18
these are taken from real life experiences here so um so yes the uh HR
12:24
is primed and ready to go to hire a bunch of data scientists so they hire this team of data scientists and they're
12:29
excited and they're ready and they're here and and they get there and they're like okay who's our manager what's uh what's mentoring look
12:37
like here what projects are we assigned to who's our PM okay all very reasonable
12:43
questions and by the way this exact scenario has happened to me um so uh the
12:49
CEO is just like uh what okay so then this the data scientists like start
12:56
trying to figure out what they could work on because it's not like they were told by anybody what they're going to work on because remember they were just
13:02
hired because everybody else was getting data scientists so the CEO needed to get them too and then they say uh where's the
13:10
data okay well um so then it comes in um well you can't have access to the data
13:17
because you don't have a business need okay probably there are people in this call who've heard this before somewhere
13:23
um we we can't give you that data because there's no data governance process but we'll get there I'm jumping
13:29
ahead okay so it then says okay but we need to give the data scientist something because we have data
13:36
scientists tears and they're sad because they don't have access to data okay so then they say aha here's an Excel
13:41
spreadsheet it's got some data that makes you happy right oh no that does not make a data scientist happy my my
13:47
day as a data scientist is very sad if I have to work in Excel spreadsheets okay so then um the data
13:53
scientists start coming up with their own ideas well if we could just collect this type of data by making this
14:00
pipeline we can somehow get it um now mind you they still don't know what problem they're solving they're just
14:05
going to go out and collect data okay and data scientists are not data Engineers one of the things that I hope
14:11
you take away from this talk is data Engineers are awesome people we need more of them you need to hire lots of
14:16
them I think the number I heard like three data Engineers for every data scientist is is a good number um so the
14:25
data scientists they start creating pipelines which are not good Pipelines they're not efficient pipelines because
14:31
they are not data Engineers but they're doing what they can okay So eventually they get some usable data and now we're
14:37
cooking here I've got the little smoke coming out of the computer indicating that the computer's now working really hard because now they have data that
14:44
they can do stuff with um and they finally get to do what they've been hired to do and are good at now notice
14:49
how many slides we've had to go through before the data scientists actually get to start doing what they're hired to do and are good at okay that's probably not
14:56
a good sign okay so now they have results and they are anxious to show
15:01
these results to people look at this thing that we made isn't it great but like they don't have anybody championing
15:07
them because remember there was no manager and there was no PM okay and yes I have lived that life and I know a lot
15:13
of other people have as well and um so they spend a lot of time trying to get under people's calendars and explain the
15:19
value of what they've done and look at this thing that we made and isn't this great oh and then there's more data
15:25
scientist here because they can't get on people's calendars and people don't recognize that what they've made is great and then we have the CEO who's all
15:32
mad saying wait a second I spent all of this money on a team and they haven't created anything of value where's my
15:38
return on my investment where's my Roi okay so that's you know unhappy CEO and
15:45
then the data scientists are like okay well I'm going to leave um and it's what they might be doing it voluntarily they
15:50
might be doing it involuntarily um because there's nothing for them to do um there's no job impact
15:56
or satisfaction they're not being mentored and growing in ways that they are looking for um there's no long-term
16:02
job prospects at the company okay and so what does that result in that results in CEO tiers okay that is the end of the
16:11
data science Fable um and I I apologize if if you've um if this is you know
16:18
resonated very strongly with you when I've given this data science or the data
16:23
Fable before I'll get people who come up to me afterwards oh my gosh you've described my past three jobs or
16:29
something like this I've lived that job too I I'm sorry that you've you've had that experience I um would like to kind
16:38
of break this apart and analyze it of how it went wrong and how to fix it okay
16:43
so let's start from the very beginning here we've got the CEO with fomo fear of missing out okay what they did they went
16:51
and hired a bunch of people but they did not identify a business problem that could only be solved with data now we're
16:57
going to come back to that word only here in a little bit there was no business problem there was meaning why
17:03
are you spending money okay just point blank why are you spending money if
17:09
there is not a business problem to be solved okay so now our next step here
17:14
was the CEO and the HR person were getting together um and they didn't have the business problem therefore they
17:20
could not identify the requirements and the skill sets on the data scientists you know here we have like this
17:26
fictitious they have to you know have PhD expert in NLP pytorch all of that
17:32
well if that if you're trying to solve a forecasting problem you don't need any of those things right um so they they
17:40
hired exactly the wrong people because they didn't know what business problem they were trying to solve okay so next
17:46
you got the data scientists coming in all excited um so here is another
17:52
problem um you remember we were talking about how I said data Engineers are really important here and that you need
17:58
to to take that away from here data Engineers were not brought in because the CEO and HR did not identify data
18:05
Engineers as being required because again no business problem okay also what
18:11
was not here is is reflected by the fact that it would not give them access to the data was that there was no data
18:17
governance put in place before bringing the data scientists on board okay so those are two things that should have
18:23
happened before any data scientists were hired at all right um so then when we
18:30
come to next here we've got the team asking where the data is okay um there
18:36
is no data yet as you recall in this story they had to go out and collect it if you recall so the business problem
18:42
had no data well there was no business problem so therefore there's no data to solve the business problem because nobody knew they needed it okay so then
18:49
here's um the governance problem um so siloing of data this is this is
18:56
something that's very common in a lot of places siloing of data indicates a
19:01
problem of data culture when you do not recognize who needs to have access to
19:06
what data it means you cannot solve data problems okay so this is this is a biggie um then here's the data
19:13
scientists who are um going and creating their own pipelines again this is the sequencing of hiring problem here um
19:22
then they created their solution but again they didn't have a PM so there was
19:27
nobody saying hey we we care about what you're creating why don't you create this thing here's a business problem
19:33
there was no person whose job it was to take their work and interface it with the rest of the company so again hiring
19:41
sequence problem okay let's let's kind of recap
19:46
what what they went for first was people okay and people are your strength
19:52
any business leader will tell you that but they're only your strength if you hire the right ones they didn't hire the
19:58
right ones in the right order second data okay they went after the data next the data scientists went after the data
20:05
and you know the value of data is not in volume but the problems it can solve
20:10
remember those stats earlier where you know like less than 1% of unstructured data was even being looked at um if you
20:19
don't know what problems your data can solve um or or what problems you have it
20:24
doesn't matter what data you have you could have tons of data you could have p btes of data but if you're not solving
20:30
problems with it it's just pointless and it actually is problematic because it opens you up to you know data leakage it
20:35
opens you up to ransomware attacks it opens you up to um you know all kinds of
20:41
pii concerns and gdpr concerns third problem okay so data scientists went and
20:48
um decided that they would find out what the problem was okay they were going to create the problem um again you know you
20:56
know where this is going that I'm going to say that the problem is actually much higher of an urgency um and then culture
21:02
it all comes back to the culture understanding how to identify business problems that can be solved by data if
21:09
it doesn't need to be solved by data don't do it you know data is expensive data scientists are
21:15
expensive when you look at this slide you'll see the order that the story went
21:20
in the Fable went in and it's exactly upside down and um for those of you who
21:25
who chimed in early rim and I were talking about Netflix recommendations um I forgot this one um those of you who um
21:33
are uh um oh my gosh why can't I even think of the name of this TV show no um
21:39
they they had this concept of the upside down and um stranger things is the name of the show sorry I was having a a
21:47
moment there um and in stranger things they have like this kind of parallel universe called the upside down and I
21:53
was I was talking to my kid who's a huge stranger things fan about this concept and she was like oh well it's like
21:59
stranger things and the upside down so that's how I've kind of created this idea of the upside down approach to data
22:05
so what we're going to do is we're going to take this thing and we're going to completely flip it as my recommended
22:11
approach for for going after problems like this okay so here's what it looks like completely flipped start with
22:18
culture culture starts at the top okay it and it's the thing that sets the
22:25
organization up for success I have yet to see see a a place that has had a
22:30
successful culture change without it starting from the top Grassroots stuff is great but without buyin of the
22:38
absolute highest levels of management of a company it is very difficult to change
22:43
the culture I'm not going to say that it never happens I would love to hear about places where it has but what you need is
22:49
from the very top of the company understanding the importance and the value of data and using data to solve
22:56
business problems being a data in and I I'm getting really sick of this term to be perfectly honest oh we're a
23:02
data driven company okay most companies don't know what that means um we'll talk about what that means here in a minute
23:09
um the problem not all problems need sophisticated data approaches to solve
23:15
them let's be real here like there are times that Excel solves that problem awesome great you do not need to hire a
23:22
team of data scientists to do that hire the data scientists when you have that
23:27
that business problem that can only be solved by data and you know complex
23:33
beyond Excel spreadsheets data okay once you've identified that problem and you
23:39
need when you identify that problem it's important to try and quantify and this is really hard I mean I go to
23:45
conferences all the time um where you have cdos trying to come up with ways to
23:51
quantify the ROI of a data solution um
23:56
you know it's it's it is not easy you have to try um once part part of that is
24:03
then understanding you know how are we collecting the data creating strategies around collecting it because that feeds
24:11
into your calculation of rois understanding what data do you need how much is it going to cost um where are
24:17
the gaps how do we um monitor its control and usage um you know that's the
24:22
data governance side too so you have to solve that data governance side and the data engineering side that's what's in
24:28
this third line here called Data okay you have to solve that before that last thing of people and go to any CD
24:37
conference and you say the words data governance and they will go running for the hills why because it's hard okay
24:44
it's it's you know there are tools out there obviously to help with data governance but they they go running for
24:51
the hills because they know they've already gotten it wrong because they did this upside down they did this in the
24:58
wrong sequence then the people the data scientists okay strategic sequential
25:05
hiring you want these people to be able to hit the ground running from the moment they hire on if these three
25:12
things are in place before you hire those people they have a much higher probability of being able to get started
25:19
immediately okay so um let's talk a little bit about data culture because
25:24
it's kind of this nebulous term and this is this is taken straight from the tableau web page um so let's see we have Collective
25:33
behaviors beliefs of people who value practice and encourage the use of data
25:39
to improve decisionmaking if data is not being used to make decisions or somehow you know
25:46
Drive revenue or something why do we have it um data is woven into the
25:51
operations mindset and identity of an organization data culture equips
25:57
everyone in the organization everyone with the insights they need to be able to truly be data driven and tackle the
26:05
most complex beta data challenges and business challenges okay so you know it's kind of nice marketing speak let's
26:12
talk about what it looks like okay first off good data culture is a participatory
26:17
Sport with a role for everyone if you are truly a datadriven business if data
26:25
that means that what you do your decision are all backed with data not with your gut but with data okay so
26:33
everyone touches data at some point whether you're a data scientist whether you
26:39
are the executive assistant to the CEO whether you are in marketing whether you
26:45
are in it whether you are in HR everyone in a good data culture touches the data
26:52
and is involved with the data there's a role for everyone um it is cultivated and grown over time
26:59
and you know so let's if we're talking startups you know you you have the opportunity to start with a good data
27:06
culture but most of us don't you know are not working for you know we are employee number two at the company out
27:12
of somebody's garage here most of us are working for companies that existed for a while and so this idea of of data being
27:22
useful driving decisions that is something that is grow you know you don't just wake up one day and say aha
27:28
we're going to do this today it takes time um and it's a way of thinking it's not just about tooling like you know I'm
27:35
sure that you know Tableau great product would love you to think it's just about tooling but it's it's also about you
27:44
know stopping you you have a business problem that you've been presented with and you stop and you ask yourself okay
27:51
what how would I go about proving this um what biases might I have in my
27:57
assumptions about solution here um what data do I need to collect you know really just thinking about the problem
28:03
in a data- minded way not even Hands-On keyboard this is you know this is the gray matter part of the process here um
28:10
we also have to recognize that not everybody is a data scientist and that's
28:15
great I love that and we need to look at ways of leveling people up and training
28:21
them um so and I I see that there's a question about how can you um what
28:28
actions can be done to cultivate a data culture is it driven by a particular person are there different personas that
28:35
should be engaged I love this thank you for that question um so let we're I'm G
28:40
to try and hit on most of these through the the next few slides here so just just bear with me for a second um but
28:47
let let's talk about the who of this question is it driven by a particular person yes all okay if you're starting
28:56
from zero it's it starts from the top obviously it's the CEO but recognizing
29:02
that not everybody is at the same place with data the CEO has to decide that it matters to them that the company be a
29:10
datadriven company the way CEOs say something matters is they put their money behind it so that means investing
29:17
in their employees investing in you know training sessions you know um is there
29:23
some course that we could send this person to such that they you know level up just a bit on their overall
29:29
understanding of how to approach a problem with data how to work with data things like this um but then it's you
29:36
know this is everybody's responsibility um to advocate for the
29:41
good and appropriate and effective use of data um okay strategy specific to
29:49
data okay so this is more of a management statement here you know higher level managements Define the
29:56
strategies how many times have if you're and I'm specifically thinking about non-tech companies I've worked in some
30:02
of those um what is can you tell me what your company's data strategy is most people
30:09
can't because a lot of companies don't have them and they need to if you're going to be a datadriven company you
30:15
need to have a data specific strategy um that that is the responsibility of
30:21
management right there um an understanding of how to measure Roi from a data product okay we talked about that
30:27
that's very complicated one of the one of the things that I've noticed in companies that I've worked with um is
30:34
you can tell a company that's at least moving in this direction based on you know they're talking about a problem and
30:40
somebody will say do we have the data to back that up you know so if somebody says here's how it is somebody else in
30:47
the room says do we have the data to back that up that's the sign that people are thinking about um you know that way
30:54
of thinking that I have here in this third bullet that way of thinking is shown in that statement do we have the
31:00
data to back that up um okay so um the identifying the right business
31:09
problem if you recall in the data Fable everything came back to the CEO not having a business problem okay what do
31:18
those business problems look like and I'm specifically speaking of data science business problems here because
31:23
this is a data science talk if the problem can be answered with a a simple SQL query you do not need a data science
31:30
scientist to do it okay you can have an analyst do this and great but data
31:38
science Pro you know problems that are right problems for data scientists are those that that are going to require
31:44
more than just SQL they're going to have modeling involved whether it's an r or in python or pick your language a choice
31:53
um next thing it will drive Roi and it's important to recognize that
31:58
Roi can be measured in many ways not just dollars it could be something like you know this made our Workforce more
32:05
efficient or this decreased our uh susceptibility to you know fill in the
32:10
blank security problem so you know understanding what what the um what the
32:18
actual uh thing the actual driver whether it's dollars whether its efficiency whatever um number of new
32:25
users things like this um it also depends on how you define success so is
32:32
Success that we have moved the needle on sales 0.5% cool but what that means is you
32:40
have to State it up front you have to know up front we're going to do this we have this problem we're gonna it's a
32:46
data problem we've identified that it's a data problem we're going to use a data science Solution on it and we will know
32:53
that that data science solution is successful when or if and you need to be
32:58
able to fill that out and until you can fill that out do not begin work you you
33:03
want and this is you know this is the role of management and this is the role of the PMS is to clearly identify what
33:09
those things are um okay and then again like I was saying before in terms of
33:15
it's not always about dollars data contribute in both D data can contribute in both direct and indirect ways so the
33:22
ROI can be difficult to determine so you know what if it's um you're providing insights so you've created some forecast
33:30
you know some you know you're using a profit model to create a forecast of you
33:36
know whatever um that forecast is being used to inform the SE Suite who then
33:41
uses it to inform strategy or whatever um how do you quantify the ROI on that
33:47
that's difficult to do um you know so you can look at some common measures you've increased your Revenue you've
33:54
decreased your cost you know you can do data monetization maybe you're a company
33:59
who sells your data um faster time to Market freeing up resources security and compliance um these are all ways um that
34:08
you could measure Roi but you want to agree on what that is upfront so you
34:13
know when you had the CEO who was like oh let's get people and then the data scientist here's a solution to a problem
34:20
that you know didn't really exist and there was no Roi behind that thing either it's not like they said to the
34:25
CEO or you know whomever calendar they got on they didn't say heyy look at this number this number um improves our time
34:33
to Market by 50% they didn't do that they just created this thing right um so this is this is something that the data
34:39
scientists can do as well um and can learn from which is to learn learn how the business works and learn something
34:46
about business um it's it's actually what's driving me to go back to school
34:52
and I'm not going to admit my age that I'm going back to school but you know I've been working for 20 plus years so you know it's been a while but going
34:57
back to school to get my MBA because I think it's really important that data scientists understand something about
35:04
how business works and how to communicate to business on in a language
35:09
that they are accustomed to and that they understand okay so I want to kind of
35:16
make a return to this slide here um this was our um CEO feeling um you know that
35:23
fomo feeling here we have a case of history repeating right so I'm just going to slightly
35:30
modify this you know I am in trouble all of my competitors are getting data
35:35
scientists if I'm going to remain competitive I need to hire some to
35:41
oops okay how many of us and I I will claim you know I'm part of this I you
35:46
know my a lot of my work right now is in generative AI but this is history repeating I'm seeing a lot of places out
35:52
there well everybody else is doing something with Gen AI therefore I need to do it as well okay okay let's let's
35:58
everybody take a step back here okay and I want to come back in my slides oops
36:05
here okay so forgetting the culture part let's
36:11
let's just look at the problem what is the problem we are trying to solve with generative AI um is is the
36:20
problem I want my um users my customers
36:25
whatever to uh be able to ask questions to something and get answers to a thing
36:31
is Gen really the solution to that or is it just that you didn't know how to implement elastic search very well maybe
36:37
that information is already out there and you just haven't given your customers the right way to access it gen
36:43
does not necessarily solve that problem and for those who have not created a production system with Gen it is
36:49
complicated it is not as cheap as anyone would lead you to believe it is expensive it is difficult to maintain it
36:56
is difficult to monitor it is difficult to quantify Its Behavior and its
37:02
accuracy um and I mean I I use Lang Smith just like everybody else for you
37:07
know measuring llms and their you know their outputs and stuff like this um I I
37:13
find it a little entertaining that our you know the the Gen Community is
37:18
letting llms measure the performance of an llm seems a little circular but that
37:23
is what's going on um but what is that business problem that gen is solving now
37:29
there are cases where I do see good business problems being solved okay those are the ones that are going to
37:35
survive right now we are in if you go look up the Gartner um hype cycle there
37:42
we are in what the Gartner hype cycle would call the peak of inflated expectations this is where everybody's
37:48
super excited about a thing and everybody's getting into it but very soon here what's going to happen and
37:55
this happened with data science Circa you I'm going to call it 2012 2013 um all of the sudden everybody's
38:02
like whoa wait a second this is not exactly as easy as I thought and it's more expensive than I thought I'm not
38:07
getting what I want out of it and people start just taking a big step back and they say whoa okay maybe maybe this
38:15
isn't the Panacea that I thought it was so you end in the gardener hype cycle in
38:20
this thing called the um the trough of disillusionment and not all Technologies recover from this okay what has to
38:28
happen in order for technology to recover from this is for them for somebody to create something useful not
38:33
even like the so-called killer app just something useful so when I you know have this slide here that talks about geni we
38:42
are in the the peak of inflated expectations I have seen countless CEOs who are all you know charging ahead with
38:49
this thing get me gen experts they need to have been programming chat GP no joke
38:54
programming chat GPT for five years okay I I saw a job ad like that um and so we
39:01
are repeating the exact same problem that we had in you know the early 2010s
39:07
in the hiring of data scientists with Genai so you know let's let's think
39:12
about how can we as data scientists um get us out of that upside down approach
39:19
here and it's it's all about us helping people get back to what is the business
39:26
problem that is the number one recommendation I I can make to you is what is the business problem um so
39:35
let's click onto here this is um just kind of a a parting quote about data
39:40
culture from Sati andella um and and I really like this quote I'm just going to leave it on the screen here for a second
39:46
for y'all to be able to read it while I grab a quick sip of
39:55
water you know so s talks about it's not just about deploying
40:00
technology um it's about changing the culture so every individual is empowered how do we Empower
40:08
individuals okay we think about you know when the um the question came in are
40:13
there different personas that should be engaged differently empowerment you know that's a that's a kind of a squishy term
40:20
everybody can Empower everybody managers have a very important role to play in in so-called empowerment
40:29
um it means bringing people together it and developers creating a cultural shift
40:36
um everyone benefits When more people can ask questions and get answers who who is it that's asking the questions
40:42
what what type of answers are they looking for those are your business problems what what are the problems that
40:48
people want answers to okay there's your business problem um and when every
40:54
employee can harness the power of data this is the invest by the company in leveling everyone up providing training
41:00
for everyone in data um so that it's you know the power of data once only
41:06
reserved for data scientists can be used for everybody and in common apps you
41:11
know this is this is a quote from 2014 this is pre gen but you know I think
41:16
these statements still hold true today of what are what are we empowering why
41:21
who what's involved how much do it cost okay all all questions to ask ask
41:27
yourself and those questions can be asked by anybody in the organization all right with that I'm
41:33
going to wrap up here I just want to thank Risha again for inviting me back to data umbrella it's a it's always fun
41:40
giving presentations here reminder of where the slides are there is a um I I think rishima put in chat the exact um
41:48
PDF um uh to the um to the slides themselves
41:54
but there is also a repository that has that PDF in there if you go go to my GitHub so with that I will just say
42:01
thank you and um open it up for
42:07
questions so I believe you answered the when rubber meets the road what actions can be done to cultivate a data culture
42:15
right yes okay um the next one is this content is incredible do you have a book
42:20
or course or something to learn from you oh thank you um I've thought about
42:26
writing a book about this um I'm having a lot of fun right now not writing books so I don't know if there's a publisher
42:34
you know in this session who wants to talk to me there's my email address feel free to reach
42:41
out I also am happy to you know speak on these subjects to you know any variety
42:46
of places so it's it's something that that I think is really important and matters a lot to me
42:54
so so while we're waiting for people to ask questions I have a question which is when you are looking at data science
43:00
jobs that are posted um and interviewing um Are there specific red flags we
43:07
should look out um is does the question relate just
43:13
to the posting or conversations and interviews as well I would say both okay
43:19
well let's start with the posting um you know and I've I've written many
43:26
job ads for you know hiring people I have interviewed many people I have interviewed many times I've applied to
43:33
many jobs um one of the things you know the good job postings in my opinion
43:41
State the problems that you're going to be working on so um you know this role
43:47
is being opened up to help us solve this type of problem okay so let's let's just
43:54
say um uh I'm just going to come up with a a natural language processing problem
44:01
okay so then I would expect in you know a good job ad that they would list things like required and desired skills
44:09
um as somebody who likes to work in NLP I know what the typical packages are you know maybe it's gen I know what those
44:16
packages are so I would expect to see those listed out in the required and desired skills if I see a disconnect
44:22
there well if I don't see a business problem or you know some sort of explanation on exact what you're going to be working on um that that's a red
44:30
flag to me um it's definitely something I would ask about if I got into a call with the hiring manager um I would also
44:39
um in a call with the hiring manager want to know things like um you know
44:45
what percentage of my time is being spent maintaining old things developing new things um if it's maintain if it's
44:54
mostly maintaining old things um to me that's that's also a red flag of you
45:00
know okay so yes code requires maintenance but you know you're hiring a full-time person to maintain something
45:07
that's you know in theory already shipped so what's that about um the uh
45:13
let's see other red flags you definitely definitely definitely want to hear from them that they know why they're hiring
45:20
into this role what problems are they specifically wanting worked on um I have
45:25
taken jobs I have you know I'm not going to name places but I I have hired into roles where they didn't they're like
45:31
yeah data scientists we're forming a data science team great what are we gonna do um and we spent four years
45:40
languishing trying to find things to do um not it's not a great use of time it's
45:46
not very fulfilling uh which roles in a company are most prepared to Define business
45:52
problems that can be solved by data okay oh this is a great question so
46:01
the there's there's a few answers to this one if you're already in a company
46:07
the PM is going to be the one who understands how to go between the business and the data scientists the
46:14
best um it doesn't mean that they're the ones defining the problems but they're working with the people who are defining
46:21
the problems um so they're going to be able to take that business language and
46:26
converted into something that is more um comfortable for data scientists to
46:32
understand but um generally speaking business problems are identified through
46:37
managers um they identify issues through you know different strategy sessions and things like this so um you know whether
46:46
you're talking a firstline manager a mid-level manager a senior manager um
46:51
depends on the size of the company but but those business problems should in
46:56
theory if they're being generated properly be tied into what is the strategy of the
47:02
company um okay for a manager of a data science team what are the best ways to advocate for data science oh or to
47:10
manage expectations of business owners in seite about what data science can and cannot
47:16
do well we could be here all day on this one um okay so the best ways to advocate
47:21
for a data science um team again I'm going to you know I'm going to sound
47:26
like a broken record here and I'm going to come back to business problems there was this business problem we solved it and here's how much better we did okay
47:32
so not just you know I didn't stop with saying we solved it you know put the little check mark next to the thing
47:38
quantify you know before our solution um our time spent on doing this thing was X
47:47
after our solution we improved it by y um and by the way that is a really
47:53
really great thing to put on your resume um when you know if if you're looking for that
47:59
next role it's it's one thing to be able to say I created a model that you know to solve x it's way better to say I
48:06
created a model to solve x that resulted in y Improvement it means that you
48:12
understand how to quantify Roi or at least approach it um and that's a very attractive thing to see in a resume um
48:19
managing expectations of business owners and seite about what data science can and cannot do that is hard hard hard
48:27
hard because like you know and this was especially true you know in our data Fable where the CEO had that fomo thing
48:32
going on um they think and this is hard you know people in this call will
48:37
understand this they think that you know machine learning is this you know it will solve everything it slices it dices
48:44
it's going to create World Peace it's going to end Hunger it's not we all know that um but they um this is about data
48:52
education and leveling up is not something that just happens in the lower ranks to the company it happens
48:58
everywhere so if as a data science manager you can help level up your upper
49:03
management and your SE suite and you know it's it's about explaining to them
49:11
you know here's the here's the pros and the cons of this thing here's the drawbacks of this thing um here is pro
49:20
prior to starting off on a project you know we would anticipate you know if we
49:26
could get an accuracy of X we could improve our you know whatever by y it's
49:33
about you know setting their expectations that no we're not going to get 100% accuracy um but you know if we
49:42
can get 85% accuracy look at how much better that is for us so it's it's not
49:47
about just saying yes we can do a thing it's about making them understand what success is and helping them define
49:53
success you know so I talked earlier about um you know being able to State
49:59
upfront before you even start work what success looks like this is part of that
50:04
conversation um so just really having a very honest conversation with them about
50:10
what is realistic and what is not uh have you ever have you seen
50:16
smaller companies using data well absolutely um I uh work with some
50:23
startups in my current role and just just some of the stuff um you know and
50:29
I'm on I I can't you know State who obviously and ndas and blah blah blah but um there there are companies out
50:36
there and and honestly I think the smaller companies have the have the opportunity to get it right a lot easier
50:43
than the bigger ones you know bigger ones they're you know they're a bohemuth you're you're trying to you know boil
50:50
the ocean with a smaller company though a couple good demonstrations of good use
50:56
of data and you got everybody's attention um so I'm thinking about you know some startups that I work with
51:01
which are like 20 people and you know they are they are companies that revolve
51:07
around data um and it's it's
51:12
really you know I hate to say you know it and you see it but like when you walk into a space and you can just say Hey
51:18
where's the data for and what is the data show um and I'm not going to argue data being plural or singular but you
51:24
know you you see just like this constant discussion about the data um and it's
51:31
it's not even just in data companies I I there are other startups that I work with in completely disparate domains and
51:38
it's you know it's go collect this go find out go measure and it's it's just
51:43
really it's it's really refreshing when you've come from a place that doesn't do that back into one that does um so they
51:50
do absolutely exist
51:57
pop over and check the chat window here real quick last call for questions if anybody has any other
52:07
questions so I'll just ask one last question which I guess is so bigger companies are not necessarily um you
52:15
know using data as well as we might expect I I don't know that I can make
52:21
that conclusion um you know when you when you got a quote from satiana Adella like that talking about data culture um
52:28
you know that would certainly point to um a higher probability of um there
52:33
being a good data culture you know where SAA at Microsoft um but it's if you have
52:39
to change the culture it's a lot harder to change a place of thousands of people than it is of tens of people um it's
52:46
absolutely the you know the easiest to do it is when a company is starting up like I said um here's a question Beyond
52:52
knowledge about more advanced modeling techniques what differentiates senior data scientists for those more Junior in
52:59
their role okay this is um this is kind of also reflect my
53:06
answer is going to reflect my time as a professor as well I spent some time uh teaching at the University of Illinois
53:12
and the question um that I would get is how do you know when somebody's ready to get their PHD when they're ready to
53:17
write it up and the easy it's it's it's really obvious to a professor when it happens because that student starts
53:23
telling the professor what to do and like not not in a boss way but like they actually have an informed and educated
53:29
opinion and they know what to do next so when I look at the difference between a senior data scientist and a junior data
53:34
scientist the junior data scientist doesn't always know um how to get started um what the right approach is
53:42
they they are um you know they're needing a lot more input versus the
53:48
senior data scientists they are they are able to propose okay here's the problem
53:54
here's a path to solving that problem so so they the senior data scientist can delegate those things to the junior data
54:00
scientist but the senior data scientist is the one who can take a problem from start to finish and know how to craft a
54:06
solution for it that's that's my opinion but um it's certainly shown itself true
54:11
in my career well that is a perfect way to end
54:18
the webinar thank you so much Claire um it was yeah it was really really a
54:23
wonderful talk um we'll have the video up within 24 hours um and we look
54:30
forward to seeing everybody at our next event great thank you everybody
54:35
