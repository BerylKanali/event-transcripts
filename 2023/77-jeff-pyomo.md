## About the Event
The seminar introduces Pyomo, an open-source modelling language for mathematical optimization problems in Python. Pyomo is powerful, flexible, open-source, easy to learn, and compatible with other Python packages. It allows users to formulate and solve various optimization problems, including linear programming, nonlinear programming, mixed-integer programming, and many others. This seminar will introduce a collection of fifty Jupyter notebooks demonstrating a wide range of data-driven applications for optimization in Python.
