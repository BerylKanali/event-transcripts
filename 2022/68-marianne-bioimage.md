## About the Event
scikit-image is a well-established Python library boasting a wide collection of image processing algorithms. We show that it is well-suited for bioimage data analysis workflows by presenting a biological application from the literature. The dataset is a time sequence of microscopy images of human cells. The presentation is intended as a step-by-step, follow-along tutorial.
