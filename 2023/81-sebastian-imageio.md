## About the Event
Get ready for an exciting and informative introduction to ImageIO! ImageIO is a popular Python library that offers powerful capabilities for reading and writing images and videos. Together, we'll explore common use cases, best practices, and anti-patterns when using the library. We'll also build intuition for ImageIO’s v3 API, which will allow us to solve complex and non-standard problems. Plus, we'll take a brief look at ImageIO's plugin system, which – among other things – allows tweaking I/O performance. And to top it all off, we'll dive into an end-to-end machine-learning example of how to use ImageIO to train a vision model. So don't miss this chance to expand your knowledge and improve your Python skills with ImageIO.
