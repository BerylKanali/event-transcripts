## About the Event
In this webinar we will go over both social and technical aspects we have to face when we contribute to ArviZ and to open source in general. I will go over all kinds of challenges: from finding an issue to work on and understanding how to work on it to submitting the pull request and addressing the feedback received. Challenges both I have faced and continue to face. The talk will be focused on ArviZ, but it should also be useful to anyone interested in contributing to open source.
