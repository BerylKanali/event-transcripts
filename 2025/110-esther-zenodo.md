## About the Event
Zenodo is a general data repository where any research output (data, presentations, research articles, software, and much more!) can be shared and preserved for the long term, increasing their visibility and impact.

Zenodo is derived from Zenodotus, the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.  It was launched in 2013 by CERN, which is The European Organization for Nuclear Research, and it is an intergovernmental organization that operates the largest particle physics laboratory in the world. It was built by researchers to ensure that anyone can join Open Science. The repository welcomes research from all over the world and all disciplines. Zenodo does not impose any requirements on format, size, access restrictions or licence. "Quite literally they wish there to be no reason for researchers not to share!"

The benefits of Zenodo include
- Being accessible: It is free
- Helping researchers receive credit by making the research results citable and through OpenAIRE integrates them into existing reporting lines to funding
- Providing a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) which is a globally unique persistent identifier for your record and is an important for discovery system to attribute citations correctly
- Preserving knowledge: deleted website content (Research shows 25% of web pages posted between 2013 and 2023 have vanished.)
- Sharing content accelerates research >> supporting Open Science and reproducibility principles
