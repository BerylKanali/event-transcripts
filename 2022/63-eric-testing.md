## About the Event
This presentation covers:
- Importance of software testing in OSS software: correctness, reliability, contracts against breakages in the future.
- Why software testing actually matters for data scientists' work as well, with a case study from my daily work.
- Where to get practice with software testing
- Navigating the tradeoff between immediate velocity and long-term productivity when deciding how much to test.

## About the Speaker
Eric is a Principal Data Scientist at Moderna supporting research data science. Prior to Moderna, he was at the Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research conducting biomedical data science research with a focus on using Bayesian statistical methods in the service of making medicines for patients. Prior to Novartis, he was an Insight Health Data Fellow in the summer of 2017 and defended his doctoral thesis in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT in the spring of 2017.
Eric is also an open-source software developer and has led the development of `pyjanitor`, a clean API for cleaning data in Python, and `nxviz`, a visualization package for NetworkX. In addition, he gives back to the open-source community through code contributions to multiple projects.
His personal life motto is found in the Gospel of Luke 12:48.
