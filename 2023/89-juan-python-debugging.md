## About the Event
Your code gives an error. Or worse: it doesn't give an error, but doesn't do what you want. Welcome to the hard part of programming! What to do now?

In this talk we will talk about debugging, which includes a broad set of techniques to identify the root causes of undesired behavior in programs and eventually fix them. We will start with a theoretical introduction of the different types of debugging, we will describe a couple of techniques that you can use, and we will apply them in practice, both in Jupyter Notebook (using its new interactive debugger) and in VSCode.
