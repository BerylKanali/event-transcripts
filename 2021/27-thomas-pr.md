00:00:00 Reshama introduces Data Umbrella
00:05:20 Thomas begins talk 
00:06:35 Terms: pull request, reviewer, contributor, merged  
00:07:12 PART 1: Mechanics of Code Review. Why code review?  
00:19:10 Browsing Code in GitHub  
00:21:50 shift+click: highlight multiple lines  
00:22:18 GitHub b: blame, tells last contributor to the code 
00:23:12 Overview of Mechanics

00:27:02 PART 2: Social Aspects of Reviewing a Pull Request 
00:27:58 Tip 1 for giving feedback: Ask, don't tell 
00:28:46 Tip 2 for giving feedback: Offer alternative implementations 
00:29:56 Tip 3 for giving feedback: Explain why code should be changed
00:39:56 DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself; refactor, having common logic in multiple places, rewrite code so you have same functionality, but this makes code more maintainable
00:31:50 Avoid using derogatory terms
00:32:32 Tip 4: Be humble, assume everyone is intelligent and well-meaning
00:33:15 Tip 5: Ask for clarification
00:34:11 Tip 6: Communicate which ideas you do not feel strongly about
00:35:02 Tip 7: Try to leave a positive comment

00:44:45 Engineering, Technical Aspects
