## About the Event
Shiny makes it easy to build interactive web applications with the power of Pythonâ€™s data and scientific stack.
If you want to develop a python web application you usually need to choose between simple, limited frameworks like Streamlit and more extensible frameworks like Dash. This can cause a lot of problems if you get started with a simple framework but then discover that you need to refactor your application to accommodate the next user request. Shiny for Python differs from other frameworks because it has tremendous range. You can build a small application in a few minutes with the confidence that the framework can handle much more complex problems. In this workshop we will go through the core limitations of Streamlit, and build a Shiny app which avoids those limitations.
