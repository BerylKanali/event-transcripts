## About the Event
Google Summer of Code (GSOC) is a program Google Summer of Code is a global, online program focused on bringing new contributors into open source software development. GSoC Contributors work with an open source organization on a 12+ week programming project under the guidance of mentors.
GSOC 2023 application begins in January 2023.

In this panel discussion, we speak with several GSOC alumni of the PyMC project to learn of their experiences including the application process, mentorship experience and post-GSOC open source participation.

Larry Dong is a PhD student in biostatistics at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Canada. His academic interests revolve around dynamic treatment regimes and Bayesian methods. He began his PhD during the pandemic which has allowed him to be immersed in open-source, particularly in the PyMC community. His first GSoC project entailed implementing a Dirichlet Process submodule for PyMC and he returned for another GSoC to continue this project and to learn more about Aesara and AePPL.

Oriol has a background in engineering physics and astrophysics and currently works as a computational statistician. He is a core contributor and council member of ArviZ and PyMC projects. He has also worked on statistical research while at Helsinki University and Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona), especially in the fields of inference diagnostics, prior elicitation and data visualization.
Oriol dedicates a lot of his time to community management and documentation because he believes they are as important as the code. He has helped organize and mentored in multiple Data Umbrella sprints. He has also mentored many new ArviZ and PyMC team members whose backgrounds ranged from computational scientist to technical writer.
