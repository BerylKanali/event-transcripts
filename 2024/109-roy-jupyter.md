## About the Event
Make your own JupyterLab extension in this tutorial. JupyterLab is a free and open source, browser based integrated development environment (IDE) that is the successor to Jupyter Notebook. Designed from the core to be extensible, JupyterLab is itself an extension of the Jupyter framework. Since its release, open source developers have contributed hundreds of third party extensions (652 third-party extensions as of 2024-10-15).

JupyterLab extensions can customize or enhance any part of JupyterLab. They can provide new themes, file viewers and editors, or renderers for rich outputs in notebooks. Extensions can add items to the menu or command palette, keyboard shortcuts, or settings in the settings system.

JupyterLab began in 2015 thanks to a $6 million grant from the Leona M. and Harry B. Helmsley Charitable Trust, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The first stable release was in 2018. Real time collaboration was added in 2021.
