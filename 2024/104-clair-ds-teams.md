## About the Event
Most data projects fail, often without reaching production or delivering business outcomes. Many companies, in their pursuit to be data-driven, adopt an "upside-down approach," leading to wasted resources and no return on investment. Success hinges on four key elements: a strong data culture, the right problem, accurate data, and the right people.

This session will define the "upside-down approach," explore what constitutes a good data culture, and discuss identifying the right business problems. Finally, we'll offer strategies for maintaining a robust data culture to ensure long-term success.

This presentation covers:

- Evidence of an unsuccessful data science team
- A “Data Fable” showing an all-to-real fictional creation of a data team
- The “upside-down” approach to creating a data science team
- Suggestions for how to right the ship if your data science team was formed using the “upside-down” approach
- Cautionary tales for the near future of data science teams and history repeating
